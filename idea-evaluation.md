Bill Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark and an early investor in Uber, lists 10 criteria to consider when evaluating two-sided marketplace businesses:  
  
- Is it a qualitatively better customer experience?  
> I think yes.  
- Does it provide an economic advantage?  
> Nope.  
- Can the technology make the marketplace more powerful?  
> Maybe.  
- Is the current market highly fragmented?    
> Definitely not.  
- Is supplier signup currently high-friction?  
> No, they have vk.com groups. It's inconvenient, but it works.  
- Is the market large enough?  
> No.  
- Can the market be expanded?  
> I don't think so.  
- How often will people transact on the platform?  
> ~ 5-15 times per day. Total.   
- How do you get paid?  
> I won't be paid, this is for fun.  
- Does adding to the network make the network more powerful?  
> Maybe, but not much.
